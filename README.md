# Module 18 - Challenge - CitiBike Data Analysis

## Introduction
Welcome to the Citi Bike Trip Analysis! In this assignment, I have completed the task of aggregating and analyzing the data from the Citi Bike Trip History Logs to uncover two unexpected phenomena. I have designed visualizations, created dashboards, and prepared a final presentation using Tableau to present my findings. This readme file provides an overview of the assignment and the work I have done.

## Requirements
* Please ensure to download the Citibike Data Files from January 2019 to January 2021 by accessing the provided link (https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html). Save these files in the designated folder before proceeding to run the CitiBike_Analysis.ipynb script. This step is crucial for obtaining accurate and up-to-date data for the analysis.


### Dataset
For this analysis, I used the Citi Bike Trip History Logs dataset as the primary source of data. I had the flexibility to choose a specific timespan or merge multiple datasets from different periods to gain comprehensive insights into the phenomena.

## Phenomenon 1: Pedal Power Metrics
For my first phenomenon, I focused on exploring the relationship between station locations, user ages, user types and trip patterns. Through careful analysis, I aimed to identify any unexpected trends or insights related to specific age groups, popular station locations, and trip duration.

## Phenomenon 2: Impact of Seasons
For my second phenomenon, I investigated the impact of seasons on Citi Bike usage. I analysed trip patterns, durations, and user behaviors during different seasons to uncover any unexpected variations or trends related to weather conditions and their effect on bike usage.

## Dashboard
To present a comprehensive analysis of the phenomenon, I created two dashboard that integrates the visualisations developed for each phenonmenon. The dashboard provides an overview of the impact of seasons on CitiBike usage, highlighting the observed variations and their potential explanations. I accompanied the dashboard with a detailed analysis that helps city officials understand the reasons behind the fluctuations in bike usage during different seasons. By effectively leveraging these visualizations, I aimed to provide actionable insights for optimizing bike-sharing programs throughout the year.

As part of the assignment, I created a basic static map that plots all bike stations in the city. I highlighted the most popular locations to start and end journeys using visual indicators. Additionally, I overlaid zip code data on top of the map to provide further context. I also included a write-up describing the trends and patterns I noticed during my analysis. This visualization serves as a valuable resource for city officials to gain an understanding of the most frequently used bike stations and the corresponding zip code areas.

## Final Presentation
For the final presentation, I utilized Tableau to create a compelling story that brings together all the visualizations, maps, and dashboards developed for the two phenomena. The presentation is designed to be professional, logical, and visually appealing. It effectively communicates the findings, insights, and analysis to stakeholders, enabling them to make informed decisions based on the data-driven observations.
