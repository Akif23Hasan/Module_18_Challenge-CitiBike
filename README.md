# Module 18 - Challenge - CitiBike Data Analysis

## Introduction
Welcome to the Citi Bike Trip Analysis! In this assignment, I have conducted a comprehensive analysis of the Citi Bike Trip History Logs, aiming to uncover two unexpected phenomena. Through the utilization of Tableau, I have curated insightful visualizations, crafted interactive dashboards, and prepared a final presentation to effectively communicate my findings. This readme file serves as a concise overview, outlining the objectives of the assignment and highlighting the analytical work undertaken.

## Requirements
* Python v3.10.9
* Pandas
* Please ensure to download the Citibike Data Files from January 2019 to January 2021 by accessing the provided link (https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html). Save these files in the designated folder before proceeding to run the CitiBike_Analysis.ipynb script. This step is crucial for obtaining accurate and up-to-date data for the analysis.


## Dataset
For this analysis, I utilized the Citi Bike Trip History Logs dataset as the primary source of data. To ensure comprehensive insights, I consolidated multiple monthly CSV raw data files into a single, unified database using Python. This consolidation allowed for a broader exploration of the phenomena while maintaining data integrity. Tableau was employed for further analysis, including calculations, visualizations, interactive dashboards, and the final data story presentation.

## Phenomenon 1: Pedal Power Metrics
The first phenomenon focused on investigating the relationship between station locations, user ages, user types, and trip patterns. Through meticulous analysis, I aimed to uncover unexpected trends and insights associated with specific age groups, popular station locations, and trip durations. This analysis sheds light on the factors influencing Citi Bike usage and informs decision-making for optimizing the bike-sharing program.

## Phenomenon 2: Impact of Seasons
The second phenomenon delved into the impact of seasons on Citi Bike usage. By analyzing trip patterns, durations, and user behaviors across different seasons, I aimed to identify any significant variations or trends influenced by weather conditions. This analysis provides valuable insights into the dynamics of bike usage throughout the year, enabling stakeholders to optimize resources and tailor strategies accordingly.

## Dashboard
To present a comprehensive analysis of these phenomena, I created two dashboards integrating the visualizations developed for each phenomenon. These dashboards provide an overview of the impact of seasons on Citi Bike usage, highlighting observed variations and potential explanations. Accompanying the dashboards is a detailed analysis that helps city officials understand the underlying reasons behind fluctuations in bike usage during different seasons. These visualizations offer actionable insights for optimizing bike-sharing programs throughout the year.

As part of the assignment, I also created a static map featuring all bike stations in the city. Notably, I highlighted the most popular starting and ending locations using visual indicators. In addition, I overlaid zip code data to provide further contextual information. To complement the visualizations, I included a detailed write-up describing the observed trends and patterns during the analysis. This visualization serves as a valuable resource for city officials to gain an understanding of the most frequently used bike stations and their corresponding station ID code areas.

## Final Presentation
For the final presentation, I utilized Tableau to craft a professional, logical, and visually appealing story. The presentation seamlessly combines all the visualizations, maps, and dashboards developed for the two phenomena. It effectively communicates the findings, insights, and analysis to stakeholders, empowering them to make informed decisions based on data-driven observations. The final presentation provides a comprehensive understanding of Citi Bike usage, highlighting key insights and recommendations for further optimization and growth.
